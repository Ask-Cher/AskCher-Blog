<p>The year end holidays are coming to an end. Just as your bank account starts to recover from the festive spending, the January tuition invoices arrive.</p>
<p><strong>Ho Ho Ho&hellip; How much are we spending this year?</strong></p>
<p>In Singapore, tuition is often treated like insurance - we buy it &ldquo;just in case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re also likely seeing ads on &ldquo;getting a headstart in 2026 with XYZ Tuition Centre&rdquo;</p>
<p>But as we head into 2026, I&rsquo;m going to share a controversial opinion:</p>
<p><strong>Your child probably does not need more tuition. They need better habits.</strong></p>
<p>Here is the reality of the landscape in 2026, and how to navigate the &ldquo;Tuition Trap&rdquo; without gambling with your child&rsquo;s grades.</p>
<h2 id="the-more-content-fallacy">The &ldquo;More Content&rdquo; Fallacy</h2>
<p>The biggest misconception parents have is that poor grades are caused by a <strong>lack of information</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t know the Science keywords.&rdquo;</em></li>
<li><em>&ldquo;They haven&rsquo;t seen this Math heuristic before.&rdquo;</em></li>
</ul>
<p>So, we hire a tutor to gril these information into their heads for 2 hours a week.</p>
<p><strong>The Reality:</strong> In 90% of the cases I see, the student <em>has</em> the information. They learned it in school. The problem is <strong>retrieval</strong> and <strong>application</strong>.
If a student is disorganized, sleep-deprived, or lacks a revision strategy, adding a tutor is like pouring water into a leaking bucket. You don&rsquo;t need more water (tuition); you need to plug the leak (study habits).</p>
<h2 id="the-3-pillars-that-beat-tuition-in-2026">The 3 Pillars That Beat Tuition in 2026</h2>
<p>With the shift towards <strong>Full Subject-Based Banding (SBB)</strong> and a push for application-based exam questions, &ldquo;drilling&rdquo; is becoming less effective. The students who thrive in this new system aren&rsquo;t the ones with the most notes; they are the ones with the best <em>systems</em>.</p>
<h3 id="1-study-technique--study-time">1. Study Technique &gt; Study Time</h3>
<p>Most students study by re-reading notes, highlighting textbooks, or doing questions over and over again. Research confirms this is the <strong>least effective</strong> way to learn.</p>
<p>Blind repetition, and just reading content isn&rsquo;t the method. A conventional wisdom that many parents have is that &ldquo;Practice Makes Perfect&rdquo;. However, I disagree with this saying as it is incomplete. As Professor Daniel Markovits from Yale University said - it is &ldquo;<strong>Perfect</strong> Practice that Makes Perfect&rdquo;.</p>
<p>So how can we ensure that any form of effort poured into revision is effective? By using <strong>science-backed</strong> strategies. There are many strategies out there, and different strategies suit different types of students. However, the most common ones are <strong>Active Recall</strong> and <strong>Spaced Repetition</strong>. Here is a comprehensive guide on how to actually use these two techniques.</p>
<p><a href="/posts/study-strategies-for-parents">Here is an article for you parents</a> to better understand these techniques and how to convey them to your children.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if your child benefits from reading about these strategies directly, <a href="/posts/study-strategies-for-students">you can find a breakdown of these strategies here</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Fix:</strong> Before hiring a tutor, teach your child <strong>Active Recall</strong> and <strong>Spaced Repetition</strong>. If they can master these two techniques, they can often outperform the &ldquo;tuition kids&rdquo; in half the time.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-the-holistic-performance-enhancer">2. The &ldquo;Holistic&rdquo; Performance Enhancer</h3>
<p>This sounds counter-intuitive, but sometimes the best thing for a failing Math grade is&hellip; basketball. Or coding. Or art.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Science:</strong> Burnout is real. A child with zero autonomy who shuffles from school to tuition to homework will eventually disengage. Passion projects build <strong>Dopamine</strong> and <strong>Confidence</strong> - two neurochemicals essential for learning. A happy, energized brain absorbs information; a bored, resentful brain repels it.</li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, the emotion regulator (the <em>Amygdyla</em>) in the brain is situated so close to our memory formation machine within the brain (the <em>Hippocampus</em>) that it is often thought that strong emotions help information to stick, while a lack of emotion is the reason why so many students often forget what they read five minutes ago.</p>
<h3 id="3-radical-ownership">3. Radical Ownership</h3>
<p>Tuition often creates a crutch: <em>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need to listen in school because my tutor will explain it on Saturday.&rdquo;</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Fix:</strong> We need to return ownership to the student. When they realize there is no safety net, they often start paying attention in class.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="but-what-if-i-really-need-tuition">&ldquo;But&hellip; What If I Really Need Tuition?&rdquo;</h2>
<p>I am not saying <em>all</em> tuition is bad. I am a tutor, after all. But there is a difference between <strong>corrective intervention</strong> and <strong>blind panic</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>You DO need tuition if:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>There is a fundamental gap:</strong> The child has missed months of school or is failing because they truly do not understand the foundational concepts.</li>
<li><strong>The Parent-Child relationship is suffering:</strong> If you cannot teach your child without shouting, outsource it. Preserving the relationship is worth the money.</li>
<li><strong>There is a teacher-student misfit at school:</strong> If the teacher at your child&rsquo;s school has a teaching style that does not complement your child&rsquo;s learning style, then get an external tutor to help.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="4-instilling-self-discipline">4. Instilling self-discipline.</h3>
<p>Since the 2000s, parents have been treating tuition as a way to ensure their children maintains contact time with their educational resources. For many parents, tuition is a discipline measure rather than an education measure.</p>
<p>Arguably, the art of self-discipline is the most important skill to master in today&rsquo;s digital era. Distractions are everywhere, and to be able to remain laser focused on the work at hand is something that must be cultivated from young.</p>
<p>In fact, the Ministry of Education has dropped a massive policy shift for 2026: Smartphones are now banned during all school hours, including recess and CCA.</p>
<p>I write more about digital discipline and the smartphone ban <a href="posts/smartphone-guidelines-2025.md">here</a>. However, here&rsquo;s a TLDR:</p>
<p>The intent of this ban is to force a &ldquo;digital detox&rdquo; and rebuild student focus and social skills.</p>
<p>The Controversial Truth: School can enforce this from 7 AM to 2 PM. But what happens at 3 PM? If your child comes home and immediately doom-scrolls TikTok for 4 hours, the school&rsquo;s efforts are wasted. You cannot outsource discipline to the government.</p>
<p>However, do you <strong>really need</strong> a tutor to do this for you? There are many <strong>cheaper</strong> alternatives that have <strong>much greater payouts</strong>.</p>
<p>The Trick: Don&rsquo;t hire a tutor to &ldquo;watch&rdquo; your child study. That is an expensive babysitter. Instead, implement a prototcol at home. If phones are locked away during &ldquo;work hours&rdquo; at school, they should be locked away during &ldquo;homework hours&rdquo; at home.</p>
<p>Pro Tip: Buy a simple $20 timed lockbox or implement parental controls on your devices at home. This teaches self-regulation better than a $50/hr tutor ever could. Having your child be self-disciplined and focus on their homework to earn some screen time is also a way to instill <strong>delayed gratification</strong>.</p>
<p>This skill of being able to focus on the task at hand and delay gratification will pay dividends for a lifetime.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-find-a-high-value-tutor-in-2026">How to Find a &ldquo;High-Value&rdquo; Tutor in 2026</h2>
<p>Of course, there is a caveat to what I wrote above - it doesn&rsquo;t apply to every child. Some children are too dependent on their devices to be detached from it without a human intervention, some students need serious help in certain areas.</p>
<p>Thus, if you decide to hire help this year, do not just look for a &ldquo;Drill Sergeant.&rdquo; The 2026 education landscape requires a <strong>Mentor</strong>.</p>
<p>Here is your checklist for interviewing a potential tutor or centre:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The &ldquo;Method&rdquo; Question:</strong> Ask them, <em>&ldquo;How do you ensure my child remembers what is taught?&rdquo;</em> If they don&rsquo;t have an answer, they are a crutch, not a coach.</li>
<li><strong>The &ldquo;Holistic&rdquo; Check:</strong> Do they care about your child&rsquo;s sleep and stress? A good tutor knows that a student sleeping 5 hours a day will never improve.</li>
<li><strong>The &ldquo;Exit Strategy&rdquo;:</strong> Ironically, a great tutor should have the goal of making themselves obsolete. They should be teaching your child the skills to eventually fly solo. This is my idealogy when it comes to tutoring.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>This January, before you sign up for that new class, ask yourself: <strong>Are we paying for progress, or are we paying for peace of mind?</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes, the best gift you can give your child isn&rsquo;t a top-tier tutor. It&rsquo;s the trust to let them figure it out, the tools to study smarter, and the time to just be a kid.</p>
