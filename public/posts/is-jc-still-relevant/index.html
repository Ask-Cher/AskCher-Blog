                    <p>We made a tiktok post summarising my last post on <a href="/posts/o-level-results-2026">JC vs Poly</a>.</p>
<p>There were some distinct camps. One camp argued that poly is better because of the hands-on approach to education.
<img src="/posts/is-jc-still-relevant/reddit-screenshot-2.png" alt="TikTok Commenter on Team &ldquo;Poly&rdquo;"></p>
<p>The other camp argued that JC is still the &ldquo;Golden Ticket&rdquo; because, statistically, it offers a smoother path to local Universities (NUS/NTU/SMU).
<img src="/posts/is-jc-still-relevant/reddit-screenshot-3.png" alt="TikTok Commenter on Team &ldquo;JC&rdquo;"></p>
<p>And someone pointed out an apparent &ldquo;irony&rdquo; of the education system.
<img src="/posts/is-jc-still-relevant/reddit-screenshot-1.png" alt="TikTok Commenter claiming JC is an Irony"></p>
<p>As the O-Level results settle, and you stare at that JAE form, I want to tackle the big question: <strong>Is the Junior College route actually still relevant?</strong></p>
<p>In an era where AI can solve H2 Math problems in seconds and write GP essays in minutes, why spend two years suffering? Why not go to polytechnique for hands-on skills? Is going to university still <em>that important</em>?</p>
<p>Here is our take.</p>
<h3 id="1-yes-jc-is-a-golden-ticket-to-university-for-most">1. Yes, JC is a &ldquo;golden ticket&rdquo; to University&hellip; (for most)</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s address the elephant in the room. Critics are right: The statistics still favor JC students for local university admissions. The route is more direct.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The Relevance:</strong> If your goal is a generalist degree (Law, Business, Humanities) and you need a high probability of entry, the A-Level route remains the most efficient &ldquo;sorting hat&rdquo; the system has. It is designed to filter for University readiness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Caveat:</strong> JC is a two-year marathon. If you&rsquo;re not open to the idea of a rigorous curriculum, on top of the overwhelming commitments that you might want to undertake to boost your portfolio, then there is a chance that you might perform too poorly to go into the University Course of your choice. The first step to success in JC is knowing what you&rsquo;re signing up for. I cover more in-detail <a href="/posts/o-level-results-2026-jc-student">here</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-the-value-in-jc-education">2. The Value in JC Education</h3>
<p>This is where the AI argument gets interesting. Yes, ChatGPT has the <em>answers</em>. But the modern economy is starting to devalue &ldquo;answers&rdquo; and overvalue &ldquo;questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>JC is a 2-year boot camp in <strong>First Principles Thinking</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>In H2 Physics, you don&rsquo;t just memorize; you derive.</li>
<li>In Economics, you learn to model complex human behavior.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>In fact</em>, for most technical courses in University (Engineering, Medicine, Law etc), the curriculum is <em>much, much</em> more rigorous than A-Levels. At A-Levels, you&rsquo;re given two years to study for one exam. In University, you study things of much greater depth, and you learn and take an exam once every Semester/ Trimester (depending on which school you study at).</p>
<h3 id="3-the-suffering-is-the-point">3. The &ldquo;Suffering&rdquo; is the Point</h3>
<p>I read a comment saying JC is &ldquo;mental torture.&rdquo; I won&rsquo;t lie—it is grueling.
But in a world of instant gratification (TikTok, UberEats, ChatGPT), the ability to engage in <strong>Delayed Gratification</strong> for two years is a superpower.</p>
<p>JC trains &ldquo;Executive Function&rdquo;—the ability to plan, focus, and endure when you don&rsquo;t see immediate results. <em>That</em> skill is more relevant than ever.</p>
<h3 id="4-there-is-still-value-in-trying-to-obtain-a-degree">4. There is still value in trying to obtain a degree.</h3>
<p>I hear a lot of chatter online hypothesizing that &ldquo;Degrees are no longer useful&rdquo; and &ldquo;Skills matter more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Singaporean context, this is dangerous advice. While skills absolutely matter, we live in an Asian society where credentialism is still the primary filter for HR departments.</p>
<p><strong>The Reality</strong>: A degree is no longer a differentiator; it is the entry ticket. It signals to an employer not just what you know, but that you have the &ldquo;trainability&rdquo; to complete a rigorous, structured program.</p>
<p><strong>The Value</strong>: Skipping the degree route is possible, but it requires you to be exceptional. For the other 99%, the degree is the safety net that prevents you from being underpaid. JC remains the highest probability bridge to that safety net.</p>
<p>Beyond that, with AI changing how things are done, core fundamentals and first principles logic (which are taught in University) are what&rsquo;s crucial. For example, a common &ldquo;hot-topic&rdquo; is software engineering, where &ldquo;vibe-coding&rdquo; has replaced entry level roles. However, core fundamentals like Data Structures and Algorithms are still important. In Machine Learning, understanding of concepts like Linear Algebra is still required.</p>
<p>If those words went over your head, just know that **University ingrains fundamental skills that you can build upon in the future. AI is not here to replace rudimentary knowledge.</p>
<h3 id="5-opinion-where-the-true-value-of-singapores-education-system-really-lies">5. (Opinion) Where the true value of Singapore&rsquo;s Education System really lies.</h3>
<p>Finally, let&rsquo;s talk about the &ldquo;System.&rdquo; People complain that our syllabus is outdated. “Why do I need to know the area of a circle in real life?”
They are missing the point. The true value of the Singapore Education System isn&rsquo;t the content—it’s the Conditioning.</p>
<p>We have one of the most rigorous, high-pressure standardizations in the world.</p>
<ul>
<li>It trains Executive Function: The ability to plan 6 months ahead.</li>
<li>It trains Emotional Regulation: The ability to sit in an exam hall, panic, and then calm yourself down to solve the problem.</li>
<li>It trains Grit: The ability to do things you hate, for a long time, to achieve a result you want.</li>
<li>It trains Thinking: The ability structure your words and your thoughts, to convert an abstract concept into something you can comprehend.</li>
</ul>
<p>And most importantly, to study for high-stakes exams, it takes us <strong>Self-Discipline</strong>. I wrote about self-discipline <a href="/posts/building-discipline">here</a>, but essentially, with devices being so distracting, how many of us can put down our devices and <strong>focus</strong> on the task at hand?</p>
<p>Hence, in however many years time, when global MNCs hire you/ your children, they aren&rsquo;t hiring because we know the atomic mass of Potassium. They hire us because they subconsciously know we have survived a system that breaks the weak. We are reliable. We deliver.</p>
<p>The education system definitely has its flaws - no system is perfect.  However, being on the optimistic side, the education system does have its merits in training us to be great.</p>
<p><strong>The Verdict:</strong>
JC is not relevant because of the syllabus. It is relevant because it is a gym for your brain. It&rsquo;s just not the right gym for everyone.</p>
