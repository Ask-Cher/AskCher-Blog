                    <h3 id="the-screen-time-battle-a-guide-for-primary-school-parents">The Screen Time Battle: A Guide for Primary School Parents</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest, every parent in Singapore has had a moment where they look at their child glued to a screen and feel a pang of worry. We all know that screens are a part of life now—from e-learning to educational apps—but how do we make sure our kids aren&rsquo;t spending too much time on them, or worse, getting distracted from their schoolwork?</p>
<p>As a tutor, I see the effects of this every single day. A student comes for a lesson and can&rsquo;t seem to focus. Another is so used to instant gratification from games that they get impatient with schoolwork. This isn&rsquo;t about banning screens completely; it&rsquo;s about helping your child build a healthy relationship with them.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="understanding-the-dangers-and-a-few-ground-rules">Understanding the Dangers (and a Few Ground Rules)</h3>
<p>The concerns about excessive screen time are very real. The Ministry of Health has even updated its guidelines recently because of it. Too much time on screens can lead to shorter attention spans, less time for physical play, and even affect your child’s social skills. The key here is <strong>intentional use</strong>. Screens can be a good tool, but only if they serve a purpose. We want our children to be active users, not passive consumers.</p>
<p>Furthermore, primary school children have highly impressionable brains. Before the age of 25, their pre-frontal cortex in the brain is still being shaped, and that&rsquo;s where lifelong perspectives and habits are formed. We have to make sure they don&rsquo;t become a lifelong slave to their screens.</p>
<p>So, how do you make sure the screen is working for your child and not against them?</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="your-practical-guide-to-healthy-digital-habits-for-your-child">Your Practical Guide to Healthy Digital Habits for your Child</h3>
<h4 id="1-set-clear-boundaries-and-stick-to-them">1. Set Clear Boundaries (And Stick to Them)</h4>
<p>This is probably the most important step. Don’t just tell your child to &ldquo;reduce screen time&rdquo;—give them clear, consistent rules. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;You have 30 minutes of screen time after you finish your homework.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;No screens during mealtimes.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;No screens in the bedroom after 9 PM.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>You can even create a simple &ldquo;family screen time contract&rdquo; together. The key is <strong>consistency</strong>. If you give in &ldquo;just this once,&rdquo; you’re sending mixed signals.</p>
<h4 id="2-make-screen-time-work-for-you">2. Make Screen Time Work for You</h4>
<p>Not all screen time is created equal. Instead of letting your child get lost in mindless games, guide them toward things that actually help them learn. Find apps that make learning fun, like those that help with math drills, spelling, or even coding. Look for content that is interactive and makes your child think, not just watch. A great example is using a timer app to help them stay focused and complete a task, turning their device into a productivity tool.</p>
<h4 id="3-use-parental-control-tools">3. Use Parental Control Tools</h4>
<p>Modern devices and apps come with built-in features that can be your best friend. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to use them. You can set time limits, block inappropriate content, and even see which apps your child uses most. These tools are not about being a &ldquo;helicopter parent&rdquo;; they&rsquo;re about creating a safe, structured digital environment that helps your child build good habits.</p>
<h4 id="4-model-the-behaviour-you-want-to-see">4. Model the Behaviour You Want to See</h4>
<p>This one is for you, parents. Children learn by watching us. If you&rsquo;re constantly on your phone at dinner, or checking emails during family time, your child will see that as the norm. Set aside &ldquo;no-screen&rdquo; times for the whole family, and show your child that you can live without a device. This teaches them the importance of balance and gives them permission to disconnect.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="its-a-marathon-not-a-sprint">It&rsquo;s a Marathon, Not a Sprint</h3>
<p>Navigating the digital world with your child is a long-term project. It&rsquo;s about teaching them self-discipline and critical thinking so they can make good choices on their own as they get older. By setting boundaries, choosing purposeful content, and modeling good habits, you&rsquo;re not just managing their screen time—you&rsquo;re preparing them for a future where technology is a powerful tool they can use responsibly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Take Action</strong>
Your child&rsquo;s digital journey starts with you. Pick one rule from this guide—like &ldquo;no screens at the dinner table&rdquo;—and commit to it for the next week. See the difference it makes.</p></blockquote>
