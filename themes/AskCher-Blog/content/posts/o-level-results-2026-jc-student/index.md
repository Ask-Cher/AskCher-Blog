Next Wednesday (14 Jan), the wait is over. You’ll get the slip, you’ll compare L1R5s with your friends, and you’ll panic-scroll through the JAE booklet.

Most of you are focused on the **Cut-Off Point**. You’re asking: *"Can I get in?"*

But as someone who has survived JC and coached hundreds of students through it, I’m telling you the question you *should* be asking is: *"Can I survive it?"*

If you’re planning to head to a Junior College, I need to level with you. The game mechanics are about to change completely. 

### 1. The "Sprint" Strategy is Dead

Let's be real. Many of us slacked for 3 years, woke up in June of Sec 4, spammed the Ten Year Series, and (probably) did okay.

That’s called **Sprinting**. It works for O-Levels because the content is manageable.

**In JC, the Sprint kills you.**
JC is a 2-year Ultra-Marathon. The content volume is triple what you just studied. If you slack in J1 thinking, *"I’ll just catch up in J2,"* you are finished.

* **The Reality:** The students who struggle the most in JC aren’t the "not smart" ones. They are the ones who try to cram a marathon’s worth of training into the final lap. You cannot "spot" questions anymore. You have to understand everything. 

Other than MCQs, questions typically haven't repeat themselves across the TYS. I've had friends who had to re-take A levels to get into a desirable course. 

Two years seems like a long time, but it will be over in a flash. Don't gamble your University chances just to have fun for a year.

### 2. "Why study when AI exists?"

I hear this a lot. *"Cher, why memorize organic chem when ChatGPT can solve it?"*

Here is the truth: **JC isn't about the answer anymore.**
In the age of AI, "knowing stuff" is cheap. **"Thinking" is expensive.**

* **Physics/Chem:** The questions aren't just *"plug in the number."* They are *"here is a weird situation you've never seen—deduce what is happening."* AI can hallucinate; *you* need the logic to catch it.
* **GP:** It’s not just English. It’s arguing. It’s persuasion. It’s learning how to think critically so you don’t get replaced by a bot in 5 years.

### 3. You Get to Try Different Things

If you hated Pure Science in Secondary School, don't blindly sign up for PCME (Physics, Chem, Math, Econs) just because your friends are doing it.

JC offers new "skill trees" like **Economics** and **Computing**.

* **Computing** is massive right now. If you have a logical brain, this is a superpower.
* **Economics** is a whole new way of seeing the world.

Don't let your L1R5 dictate your subject combination. Let your *interest* dictate it. You’re going to be married to these subjects for 2 years—make sure you don't hate them.

### 4. Freedom is a Trap

In Secondary School, teachers chased you for homework.
In JC, nobody typically chases you.

You can skip lectures. You can sleep in tutorials. Nobody will call your parents (at least not until it gets out of hand).
**This is the trap.**

The "Foundation" of JC isn't just about knowing your formulas. It’s about **Self-Discipline**. The students who win at A-Levels are the ones who can sit down and study when nobody is watching.

### 5. It's Still Important to Play, in Moderation

I had fun in JC, while managing my studies consistently. It's possible to do both, but exercise restrain. 

While it's crucial to not get caught up in fun and flunk your exams, it's important to create precious memories and share moments with your circle of friends. This is likely the last few years you'll enjoy the innocence of school, without much worry of what the distant future holds. 

### The Bottom Line

All the best to all the readers! Next Wednesday, celebrate your results. You earned them. 

But from Thursday onwards, if you're planning to go to a JC, it's time to get your head in the right head space.
