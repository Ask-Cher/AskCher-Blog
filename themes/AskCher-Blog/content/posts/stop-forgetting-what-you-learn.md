#Mugging for Exams? Why Your Brain Keeps Forgetting, and What to Do About It.
Every student in Singapore knows this feeling: you just spent the whole night mugging for your prelims, but a few weeks later, you can't remember a single thing. It feels like all that hard work just vanished into thin air.

As a tutor, I see this all the time. Students put in a ton of effort, but because they're using the wrong strategies, their learning doesn't stick. The problem isn't that you're lazy or not smart enough—it's that you're up against something called the Forgetting Curve.

## What Exactly Is the Forgetting Curve?

Hermann Ebbinghaus figured out that we forget things really, really fast, especially right after we learn them. The Forgetting Curve is basically a chart that shows how your memory drops off over time if you don't do anything to stop it.

Think of it like this: your brain is a bit like a leaky bucket. You pour in new information, but if you don't keep topping it up, it all drains away. This is why cramming for a test is so inefficient. You might pass the exam, but the knowledge is temporary. You're just filling the bucket right before the test, only for it to be empty again soon after.

So, how do we fix the leak? It’s not about studying harder, but studying smarter.

## 5 Study Strategies That Really Work

The good news is that the Forgetting Curve isn’t unbeatable. As a tutor, I’ve seen these strategies help countless students not only remember more but also understand concepts on a much deeper level.

### 1. Don't Cram, Space It Out

This is probably the most important tip. Instead of doing one huge study session, spread your revision out over time.

For example, when you're studying for your O-Level Chemistry exam, don't try to master the whole topic of Acids and Bases in one sitting. Instead, study it on Monday, then revisit the key concepts on Wednesday, and again on Saturday. Each time you review, you're strengthening the memory, pushing it from your short-term brain into your long-term memory vault.

You can use flashcards or apps like Anki, which are designed specifically for this spaced repetition technique.

### 2. Test Yourself, Don’t Just Read

A lot of students make the mistake of just re-reading their notes and textbooks. They think, "Oh, I've read it five times, so I must know it!" But that's passive learning. It gives you a false sense of security.

Instead, practice active recall. This means you force your brain to retrieve information without any help. Try these:

Close your book and try to explain a concept in your own words.

Turn the subheadings in your notes into questions and answer them from memory.

Use practice papers or self-quizzes to see what you actually remember.

This is the effortful part of learning, and it’s what truly makes knowledge stick.

### 3. Connect the Dots

Ever wonder why you remember a story so much better than a list of facts? It's because your brain loves connections. So, instead of memorizing information in isolation, link new concepts to things you already know.

For example, when studying the Water Cycle for your Primary Science exam, don't just memorize the steps. Think about what a hot kettle on the stove has in common with evaporation. See how water droplets form on a cold can of Coke and relate it to condensation. Making these connections makes the information meaningful and therefore, easier to recall.

### 4. Mix It Up

Studying one subject for hours on end can lead to mental fatigue. Instead, try interleaving. This means switching between different subjects or topics within a single study session.

For example, instead of doing your full three-hour math block, you could spend one hour on A-Level Mathematics, then switch to one hour of Economics, and then finish with another hour of math. This forces your brain to constantly retrieve different types of information, which helps you differentiate between concepts and strengthens your overall learning.

### 5. Your Brain Needs a Break (and Sleep)

This is a big one. I know many students who pull all-nighters. While it might seem productive, it's actually counterproductive. Sleep is when your brain consolidates memory. It's like a librarian tidying up the books you used during the day and putting them in their proper place. Without enough sleep, that information gets lost.

Don't sacrifice your sleep for an extra hour of studying. You'll get diminishing returns and likely perform worse on your exam. A healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise and good food, also makes a massive difference to your brain power.

Take Control of Your Learning

The Forgetting Curve is a natural part of how our brains work, but it doesn't have to control your academic results. By using these simple, evidence-based strategies, you can turn passive learning into an active and dynamic process.

Don't just be a student who crams—be one who truly learns. Start with one of these techniques today, and you’ll see the difference it makes in your next test and beyond. 

What strategy will you try first?
