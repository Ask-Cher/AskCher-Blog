# Stop "Mugging" Blindly: The Student's Guide to Spaced Repetition & Active Recall

We've all been there.

It's 11 PM. You are staring at your Biology notes. You have highlighted so many sentences that the textbook is basically glowing in the dark. You feel like you've been studying for hours.

Your parents have high expectations of you, but you're not too sure if you'll make them satisfied with your grades.

But then, the next day during the test, you stare at Question 3 and ... **blank.**

You *know* you read that page. You remember highlighting it in neon pink. But you can't actually remember the answer.

Here is the hard truth that nobody tells us in Sec 1: **We are studying wrong.**

Most of us study by re-reading and highlighting. This feels productive, but it's actually a trap called the **"Illusion of Competence."** It tricks your brain into thinking you know the material just because you recognize it.

If you want to stop pulling all-nighters and start getting A1s, you need to use the two "cheat codes" of learning science: **Active Recall** and **Spaced Repetition**.

Here is how they work, and how I actually use them to survive school.

## Cheat Code #1: Active Recall (The "Sweat" Method)

Imagine you want to get stronger.

* **Passive Studying (Re-reading):** This is like watching a YouTube video of someone lifting weights. You understand the form, you nod along, but your muscles aren't growing.
* **Active Recall:** This is actually lifting the heavy dumbbell. It's hard, it's annoying. You might fail a rep. **But this is the only way you get strong.**

**What is it?**
Active Recall is the act of closing your book and forcing your brain to retrieve information *out* of your head, rather than trying to stuff it *in*.

**Why it works:**
When you struggle to remember a formula or a date, that struggle sends a signal to your brain: *"Hey! This info is important! Build a stronger connection!"* If studying feels easy, you probably aren't learning much.

## Cheat Code #2: Spaced Repetition (Hacking the "Forgetting Curve")

There is a guy named Ebbinghaus who discovered that we forget about 50% of what we learn within 24 hours. Depressing, right?

This is why cramming fails. You stuff it all in on Monday night, and by Wednesday morning, half of it is gone.

**Spaced Repetition** is the hack to stop this leak.

Instead of studying a topic for 5 hours in one day (and then ignoring it for a month), you space it out:

* **Day 1:** Learn it.
* **Day 2:** Review it (15 mins).
* **Day 5:** Review it (10 mins).
* **Day 14:** Review it (5 mins).

Every time you review it *just* as you are about to forget it, you reset the clock. By the time the exam comes, the info is locked in your long-term memory.

## The Toolkit: How to Actually Do It (Without Going Crazy)

Okay, the science is cool, but how do you actually do this when you have 8 subjects and CCA until 6 PM? Here are my 3 go-to methods.

### 1. The "Blurting" Method (For Heavy Content)

This is great for subjects like History, Geography, or Biology.

1. Read a section of your textbook/notes.
2. **Close the book.** Hide it.
3. Get a blank piece of paper.
4. Write down everything you can remember. Scribble diagrams, keywords, dates. **Do not peek.**
5. Once you are completely stuck, open the book.
6. **Take a Red Pen** and fill in what you missed.

**Why this rocks:** The stuff in Red is what you *actually* don't know. Next time, focus on the Red stuff.

### 2. The Flashcard System (For "Dead Time")

Singaporean students spend a lot of time on buses and MRTs. This is prime Spaced Repetition time.

* **Don't** just flip through notes.
* **Do** use an app like **Anki** or **Quizlet**.
* **The Rule:** Look at the question. **Say the answer in your head.** Then flip the card. If you got it wrong, be honest and mark it as "Hard." The app will automatically show you that card again tomorrow (Spaced Repetition!).

### 3. The "Traffic Light" Retrospective Timetable

Stop making forward-planning timetables ("On Monday 8 PM I will study Math"). You never stick to them, and then you feel guilty.

Instead, try a **Retrospective Timetable**.
Make a spreadsheet with all your topics.

* When you review a topic (using Active Recall!), mark the date.
* **Color code it based on how you felt:**
* 🔴 **Red:** I had no clue. (Need to review again Tomorrow).
* 🟡 **Amber:** I remembered some, but it was hard. (Review in 3 days).
* 🟢 **Green:** Too easy. (Review in 2 weeks).

Now, when you sit down to study, you don't waste time deciding what to do. You just look for the **Red** topics that you haven't touched in a while. With more time to spare, review the **Yellow** topics. The goal is to eventually shift all these to **Green**.

## Final Words

Look, I know the instinct is to just open the TYS and grind through questions, or to re-write your notes in pretty colors.

But if you want to have a life outside of studying-if you want time for gaming, hanging out, or just sleeping,you need to be efficient.

**Active Recall** hurts more than passive reading. It's frustrating to stare at a blank page and struggle to remember. But that struggle is where the A1 is made.

Try the "Blurting" method for just one subject this week. You'll be surprised at how much sticks.
