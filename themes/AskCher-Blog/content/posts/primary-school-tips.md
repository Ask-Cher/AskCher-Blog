## The Primary School Juggling Act: A Guide for Parents

If you're a parent of a primary school child in Singapore, you know the drill. From the moment your child starts Primary 1, it feels like a race. You're trying to figure out the best way to help them keep up, stay on top of their work, and, most importantly, thrive.

Singapore's education system is famous for being one of the best in the world, but it can also be tough to navigate. As a tutor, I've seen countless parents get stressed out trying to balance everything. This guide isn't about giving you generic advice; it's about sharing practical tips I’ve picked up from years of helping students and their families.

### Understanding the System (and the PSLE)

Primary school is a six-year journey. The first four years, P1 to P4, are all about building a strong foundation in core subjects like English, Mother Tongue, Maths, and Science. This is where your child learns the basics and develops their love for learning.

Then, things get a bit more serious in P5 and P6, as the focus shifts towards the **Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE)**. We all know how much pressure the PSLE brings. It’s a major milestone that determines which secondary school your child will go to. It's a high-stakes exam, and the stress can be real for both parents and children.

But remember, the PSLE is just one part of the journey. What you do now to support your child will matter far more than just drilling them for a test.

### Actionable Tips for Parents

Here's my advice, based on what I've seen work for families in Singapore:

#### 1. Don’t Just Tell Them to Study, Help Them Learn

Instead of just telling your child to go and study, take some time to understand **how** they are taught. Singapore's curriculum, especially for Maths and Science, is very conceptual. They don't just memorise; they need to understand the "why" behind the "what." Ask your child about what they learned in class. Use everyday situations to reinforce concepts—like counting money at the hawker centre or discussing why it rains. This makes learning feel less like a chore and more like a part of life.

#### 2. Create a “Study Time” Routine

Children love predictability. Setting up a consistent daily routine for homework and revision helps them develop good habits. Designate a specific, quiet corner for study, free from distractions like TV or video games. Make sure they get enough rest and downtime. Trying to do homework when they're tired or overworked is a recipe for frustration.

#### 3. Talk to the Teachers

Your child’s teacher is your best ally. They see your child every day and can give you invaluable insights into their progress, personality, and any struggles they might be having. Don't be shy about asking questions. A quick email or a chat during a parent-teacher meeting can make all the difference.

P.S. A school teacher's job is really tiring, so it's best to avoid contacting them after-hours, especially if they were kind enough to provide their personal contact. 

#### 4. Balance Is Key: Don’t Overdo the Tuition

It's tempting to fill every after-school hour with tuition and enrichment classes. But this can lead to burnout. Your child needs time to just be a kid — to play, to relax, and to discover their own interests through CCAs or hobbies. A child who is well-rested and happy will always learn better than one who is stressed and exhausted from a packed schedule.

#### 5. Teach Them to Be Resilient

The journey to national exams (PSLE/O Levels) can be tough, with setbacks and disappointments along the way. Instead of focusing only on grades, focus on **effort and improvement**. Celebrate when they try a difficult problem and don't give up. Teach them that mistakes are part of learning. A child who learns to bounce back from a bad test result will be much better prepared for the challenges of secondary school and beyond.

### You Are Your Child's Best Tutor

Navigating the primary school years can feel overwhelming, but your role is more important than any textbook or tuition centre. By understanding the system, setting up good habits, and—most importantly—supporting your child's well-being, you are giving them the tools they need not just to succeed, but to thrive.

> **Take Action**
> Navigating the education scene in Singapore can be tough, but here's what I always emphasise to parents and students alike : Focus not on the results, but on the process and on what it will make of them.
