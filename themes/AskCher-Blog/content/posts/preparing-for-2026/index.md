## School in 2026: The New Normal, The "Full SBB" Reality, and The AI Elephant in the Room

2026 is shaping up to be a unique year. We are moving past the "pilot" phases of many big policies and settling into a new reality. The days of rigid streaming are (mostly) gone, technology is everywhere (but also restricted), and the PSLE scoring system is fully entrenched.

Whether you have a P1 newbie or a teenager entering Upper Secondary, here is a brief breakdown of the key things you need to note for the 2026 academic year.

### 1. Secondary School: "Full SBB" is the New Standard

By 2026, **Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB)** is the reality for Secondary schools. 

Since SBB began to be fully implemented in 2024, starting from Secondary One students, this means that "Express," "Normal (Academic)," and "Normal (Technical)" should not exist in 2026 anymore. 

In case you're still adjusting to it, here are some things to note:

* **Mixed Form Classes:** Your child will be in a form class with students taking subjects at different levels (G1, G2, G3). This is great for social mixing, but it means the "my friends are all studying the same thing" mentality is gone.
* **The "G" Levels:**
* **G3** = Express standard
* **G2** = N(A) standard
* **G1** = N(T) standard


* **The Schedule Chaos:** Because every student has a personalized combination of subjects (e.g., G3 English, but G2 Math), timetables are complex. Students move around *a lot*.
* **Tip:** While this change is not that welcoemd by every parent, it's a good opportunity to use the new system to tailor a curriculum that suits your child's learning capabilities. If your child struggles to cope with G3, you may consider discussing with the school teacher on switching to G2 instead. Remember - mental and physical health comes before any academic achievements.

### 2. The "Smart Nation" Dilemma: AI and PLDs

By 2026, the novelty of the Personal Learning Device (PLD)—usually a Chromebook or iPad—has worn off. However, the rise of Generative AI (like ChatGPT and Gemini) has changed how homework is done.

**What to Note:**

* **AI Plagiarism is on the Radar:** Teachers are now savvy. They know when an essay sounds "too robot." Ensure that your child knows the importance of not letting AI do the thinking for him/her.
* **Tip:** Make sure your child is able explain *how* they used AI for their homework. If they can’t explain the concept, they didn't learn it; the bot did.

### 3. Primary School: The Mature "AL" System

The Achievement Level (AL) scoring system for PSLE has been around for a few years now, and the dust has settled. We now know the patterns.

**What to Note:**

* **Every Point Counts (Literally):** In the old T-score days, a 230 and a 232 were basically the same. Now, the difference between an AL4 and an AL5 in one subject can drop your total score from a Band 1 school to a Band 2 school.
* **Choice Order Matters More Than Ever:** In 2026, "Tie-Breakers" are common. If two students have the same score, the one who put the school as a *higher priority choice* gets in.
* **Tip:** Stop obsessing over "90 marks." An 89 and an 80 are the same band (AL2). Focus on consistency rather than perfection. If your child is scoring 78, push for that extra 2 marks to jump a band. If they are scoring 85, maintain it and focus on other weaker subjects. We should always optimise for **Return on Effort**.

### 4. The "Hard" Stance on Soft Skills (CCE)

Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) isn't just a "slack" period anymore. MOE has doubled down on mental health and cyber wellness.

**What to Note:**

* **Peer Support Structures:** Schools are actively training students to look out for each other. You might hear your child talk about "peer supporters" or "wellness ambassadors."
* **Cyber Wellness Classes:** These are getting graphic and real. Schools might even be discussing scams, deepfakes, and algorithm addiction.
* **Tip:** Don’t roll your eyes when your child talks about CCE. Use it as a dinner table conversation. "What did they teach you about deepfakes today?" It opens the door to discuss their digital life without sounding like an interrogator.

### 5. The "Phone-Free" School Culture

As discussed in my previous posts, the smartphone ban is likely in full swing by 2026.

**What to Note:**

* **Logistics have changed:** You can't text your child "I'm running late" at 1:55 PM. You need to coordinate pick-ups beforehand.
* **The "After-School" Rush:** Be prepared for a flood of messages the moment school ends.

### Summary: The 2026 Mindset

If I had to sum up attending school in 2026 in one word, it would be **"Adaptability."**

The rigid structures of the past are melting away. Students have different subject levels, different technology tools, and more emphasis on well-being. For parents, this means we need to stop comparing our child’s journey to our own ("Last time when I was in school...").

The system has changed. The best thing we can do is stay informed, stay calm, and help our kids navigate these new currents.
