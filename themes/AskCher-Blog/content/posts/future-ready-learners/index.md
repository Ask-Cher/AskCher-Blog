### **Nurturing Future-Ready Learners: Navigating the New Era of Learning**

As parents, you strive to provide the best possible educational foundation for our children. The world of primary education, however, is far from static. It's a dynamic landscape, constantly reshaped by societal shifts, technological advancements (AI in particular), and evolving pedagogical approaches. Here, I draw on recent trends and personal experience, aims to shed light on the most significant developments in primary school education, offering a blend of formal insights and practical advice from an experienced educator's perspective.

### The Shifting Landscape of Learning: Beyond Traditional Classrooms

One of the most profound shifts in primary education is the increasing diversification of learning environments. The traditional classroom model, while still prevalent, is no longer the sole pathway for a child's foundational education. We are witnessing a significant surge in adoption in Home-Based Learning (HBL). This isn't merely a post-pandemic anomaly; it represents a fundamental change in how parents perceive and pursue education for their children. This shift reflects one thing: a push to provide students with more opportunities to learn independently and to be more self-directed in their learning.

But, why is self-directed learning crucial? Regular HBL sessions instill important skills like time management, self-discipline, and resourcefulness, which are crucial for future academic and professional success. This enables people to stay relevant by constantly adapting their knowledge and skills, cultivating essential human competencies that AI cannot replicate.

### Beyond the Textbooks: Nurturing the Whole Child

Today, it is not just about academic excellence anymore. Research shows that to truly succeed, a child needs more than just a keen mind. And we should all be fully committed to **holistic development** of our students.

#### Soft skills in the era of AI

The **21st Century Competencies (21CC)** framework is a central part of this. It is about teaching essential skills like **critical thinking, communication, collaboration, and problem-solving**. These are the "soft skills" that are becoming increasingly vital for a future where jobs and technology are constantly evolving.

#### Social-emotional Learning

There is also a strong push for **Socio-emotional Learning (SEL)** and mental well-being. Schools are putting more effort into teaching children how to manage their emotions and be resilient. This is beneficial, as a child who feels confident and happy will naturally perform better in their studies.

#### Learning to fail

Something many parents, students and teachers avoid, is learning how to fail. Learning how to fail is one of the most important lessons a child can learn in primary school. It may seem counterintuitive, but navigating disappointment and setbacks is a fundamental skill for building a confident and adaptable person.

Learning how to fail is the key to developing a growth mindset. This is the belief that abilities and intelligence are not fixed traits, but can be developed through dedication and hard work.

Without this lesson, a child who gets an answer wrong might think, "I'm not smart enough." With a growth mindset, they learn to think, "I can't do this **yet**." This small shift in perspective transforms mistakes from a sign of inadequacy into a necessary and normal part of the learning process. When they experience a small form of failure, they learn to process that frustration, to try again, and to not give up. This inculcates resilience in them, for when they face inevitable difficulties in time to come.

#### The Parent’s Role in Teaching Failure

As a parent, your role is to help your child navigate failure in a healthy way.

Normalize Mistakes: Share stories of your own failures and how you learned from them. This shows them that mistakes are part of being human.

Focus on Effort, Not Just Outcomes: Instead of saying, "You got an A\!", say, "I'm so proud of how hard you studied for that test." This reinforces that effort and process matter more than a single result.

Frame it as a Learning Opportunity: When your child fails, ask them, "What did you learn from this?" or "What will you do differently next time?" This helps them focus on the lesson, not the disappointment.

Ultimately, teaching a child to handle failure isn’t about wanting them to fail. It's about giving them the tools to cope when things don't go as planned, building the confidence to try again, and preparing them to thrive in a world where perseverance and resilience are essential for success.

> We should prioritise soft skills, emotional resilience and learning to fail.

### The Tech/ AI Revolution: Tech can be a good servant, but a bad master

When we hear about AI, some of us may feel a little confused or even worried. Will AI replace tutors? Is what my child learning in Primary School even important, when AI can do everything? Should my child embrace AI or not?

#### AI is here to help

MOE’s **EdTech Masterplan** is about using AI to make learning more personalized. In the **Student Learning Space (SLS)**, you will find tools that are like having a personal tutor for your child. They provide instant feedback on math questions or help with writing. This allows your child to learn at their own pace, which is excellent for building confidence.

Beyond schools, free tools such as Gemini or Perplexity can help to break down complex information into bite-sized building blocks.

**Pro Tip:** If you are struggling to explain something to your child, try explaining it to any of the LLMs, and include "How would you explain everything above to a 10-year old child? Use simple terms, and analogies."

#### Don't let AI erode the learning experience

Of course, too much of a good thing can be detrimental. If AI can be used to obtain answers at the click of a mouse, then your child will skip the whole process of understanding and problem-solving. Remember, while the answer is important, the process of getting there is what's transferrable, even after primary school.

**Pro Tip:** If you or your child is struggling with a question, try uploading the question to any LLM, and prompt it using the following "Teach me how to solve this question. I don't want the answers directly, I want to understand the step-by-step process of breaking down this question, and working through each individual concept so that I may apply the same problem-solving approach to future problems. " Once you/ your child understands the approach, ensure they close the tab and work through the problem by themselves once more.

**Pro Tip 2:** Always remember to check the AI's answer. The real learning is in the process, and critically evaluating the result is part of that.

#### Pay Extra Care to the Distractions of Technology

Research found that children who spent more than two hours a day on screens scored lower on language and thinking tests. Some with over seven hours a day even experienced a premature thinning of the brain's cortex, a critical area responsible for processing information and memory [1]. While the Ministry of Health recommends that children between seven and twelve years old limit recreational screen time to less than two hours a day, data from a local study shows that many children, particularly at the preschool level, already exceed this guideline [2]. It is crucial to understand that the brain is rapidly growing in these primary school years. Unstructured screen time can overstimulate the visual cortex at the expense of other areas vital for language, emotional understanding, and social skills, ultimately hindering the holistic development we strive for.

This is also a great opportunity to teach your children how to reject distractions.

1.  Create "Tech-Free" Zones and Times: Make a family rule that certain spaces and moments are completely free of screens. This could include the dinner table, bedrooms after a certain hour, or during family outings. This not only limits screen use but also promotes face-to-face communication and connection.

2.  Establish a Purpose-Driven Mindset: Teach your child to use devices with a specific goal in mind. Before they pick up a tablet, ask, "What are you going to use it for?" If the answer is "to play a game," set a clear time limit. If it's for homework, define the task and encourage them to put the device away once it's complete.

3.  Use Technology to Manage Technology: Many devices and apps now have built-in parental controls. Tools like Google Family Link or Apple's Screen Time allow you to set daily time limits, schedule "downtime," and even restrict access to specific apps. This takes the burden of constant enforcement off your shoulders and puts a system in place.

4.  Offer Attractive Alternatives: Don't just take away a device without offering something in its place. Brainstorm a list of engaging, non-screen activities with your child, such as reading, drawing, playing with a pet, building with blocks, or playing outside. This helps them learn to entertain themselves in a way that fuels their creativity and well-being.

> Start managing screen time early, avoid dealing with greater problems down the road.

### The Critical Role of Parental Involvement

I know many of you are busy working parents, and your involvement might feel like "selective involvement" as research suggests [3]. You attend parent-teacher meetings and communicate with tutors, but you may not have time for school volunteering. That is perfectly acceptable. What is most important is to be present and to show you care.

For homework, studies are clear: quality is more important than quantity. Our children spend, on average, **9.4 hours a week on homework**, and it genuinely helps with academic performance [4]. But please, do not do the work for them.

  * **Create a Study Corner**: Find a quiet spot for them to do homework. A clean desk with good lighting and no distractions is key. A dedicated study corner helps a child focus and build good habits by creating a designated, distraction-free space for learning. This promotes better concentration, organization, and a positive mindset toward their academic work.
  * **Guide, Don't Give Answers**: When they are stuck, ask a question to help them figure it out. "What did the teacher say about this topic?" or "Can you show me your workings?" This teaches them how to think for themselves.
  * **Focus on Effort, Not Just Results**: Praise them for trying hard, even if they make mistakes. This helps them feel less stressed and builds a growth mindset.

#### How Parents Can Be the AI Coach at Home

The key to successful AI integration is **purposeful use**. Think of AI like a very smart calculator or a dictionary. You still need to know how to do the math and understand the words yourself.

Here are some tips:

  * **Encourage Critical Thinking**: When your child uses an AI tool, ask them questions like, "How did the AI get that answer?" or "Does this sound right?" Teach them to verify their work and not simply copy and paste.
  * **Be a Digital Citizen Mentor**: As more apps appear, we need to talk to our children about online safety and protecting their privacy. Advise them, "Please don't just click on every link."
  * **Find a Balance**: The Health Promotion Board recommends a maximum of one hour of screen time for young children, so try to adhere to that guideline [5]. Ensure the time they do spend on devices is for learning, not just for games or entertainment.
  * **Support Creativity**: Encourage your child to use AI for ideas, but then to go and create something original themselves. AI is a tool to enhance their thinking, not to replace it.

### Building Skills at Home

Your home is like a second classroom for those important **21st Century Competencies**.

> "Education is what remains after one has forgotten what one has learned in school." - Albert Einstein

  * **For Communication and Collaboration:** At dinner, ask everyone to share about their day. When you are deciding what to eat, involve your children in the discussion.
  * **For Critical Thinking:** When you see something in the news or online, talk about it together. Ask, "What do you think is really happening?" and "Is this a reliable source?"
  * **For Creativity:** Instead of buying a toy, ask them to make one out of recycled materials. Challenge them to come up with new ways to do everyday things.

What your child experiences outside of school is as critical as, if not more crucial than, what he learns in school. Everyday is a daily opportunity to inculcate important skills in your child.

### Navigating Academic Transitions

The **transition to Primary 1** is a significant one, for both parents and children. Do not just focus on them knowing their ABCs and 123s. The real secret to success is preparing them emotionally. Make sure they know how to make friends, how to handle small problems, and how to be independent.

The Ministry of Education regularly updates the syllabus. You may hear that certain topics are gone (like "Cells" from Primary 5 Science) and new things are included (like coding\!). This is all part of the plan to reduce memorization and get them to think more deeply. Therefore, it is important to stay in touch with the school and be open to these changes.

### Looking Forward

Our children are growing up in a world that is very different from ours. They need to be adaptable and creative, not just proficient at rote learning. While the PSLE can feel like a major event, remember it is just one part of a bigger journey.

Your role as a parent is the most influential part of this educational evolution. By understanding these changes, embracing technology in a smart way, and fostering a love for learning at home, you are giving your child the best possible chance to succeed.

The future of primary education in Singapore is rigorous, but it can still be meaningful beyond just grades. Success in this environment requires an active, informed partnership between parents and schools. Together, we can ensure our children are truly ready for the challenges and opportunities ahead.

> Food for thought: In this era of AI and hyper-competitiveness, what is one thing you would like your child to develop, beyond the grades?
