As a tutor in Singapore (and also a former student of the Singapore education system), I see it all the time. Parents are so focused on getting their child to score that A for PSLE/ O levels/ A levels, the focus is on more and more tuition. But what if there’s something far more important than just having a good grade?

Before we talk about mastering tough subjects, let’s talk about building the foundation: **self-discipline and focus**. These are the two qualities that will help your child learn better, stay on track, and ultimately succeed in life, not just in school.

In today's world, where distractions from phones, tablets, and video games are everywhere, a child's ability to focus deeply is a true superpower. Think about it—a student who can sit down and finish their homework without getting distracted is already a step ahead. This isn’t about being strict; it’s about giving your child the tools to manage themselves and their own learning.

### The Long-Term Impact: Why Discipline Matters in the Long Run

As a tutor, I've had the privilege of teaching students from Primary school all the way to Junior College. While every student's journey is unique, I've noticed a recurring trend: students who rely heavily on tuition and external help in the earlier years often start to struggle at higher levels of education.

Just recently, I had a 30-minute conversation with a bright Integrated Programme (IP) student. Despite her excellent results in the past, she was falling behind in her current subjects. Her reason? She "couldn't seem to stop doom scrolling" and felt she had "no time" to revise.

This student is not alone. She is a perfect example of someone with the potential for success, but whose lack of focus and self-discipline has begun to compound. At the higher levels of education, like in the IP or at Junior College, the sheer volume of content means that simply listening in class or attending tuition is no longer enough. Students must take ownership of their own learning. The habits of discipline and focus that you nurture in your child now are not just for passing the next test, but for navigating the academic demands of the future.

### Practical Ways to Nurture Your Child's Focus at Home

You don't need to be a strict parent to teach your child self-discipline. It’s all about creating an environment and a routine that helps them succeed. Here are some simple, practical things you can start doing today. These are also approaches I take with my students, although with slight modifications according to their education level and personality.

#### 1. Set a "Homework Time" (and Stick to It)
Arguably, this is the most important. Children thrive on routine. When they know what to expect, they feel more secure and are less likely to push back. So, create a clear, consistent schedule. For example, every weekday, "Homework Time" is from 4:30 PM to 5:30 PM. Let them know this is their dedicated time for schoolwork. By sticking to this schedule, you are teaching them **consistency and responsibility**.

#### 2. Break Big Tasks into Small Steps
Primary school children can feel overwhelmed by a long list of homework. When they see a whole page of math questions or a long composition to write, they might get discouraged and give up.

Help them by breaking it down. For example, tell them: "First, let's just do the first five math questions. After you finish those, we can take a two-minute break." This makes the task seem less scary and gives them a sense of accomplishment with each small step, building their confidence.

#### 3. Praise the Effort, Not Just the Results
It's easy to say, "Good job! You got an 'A'!" But what if they tried really hard and didn't get the 'A'? It’s more important to praise the effort they put in. Say things like: "I saw how hard you worked on that science project," or "You were so focused during your spelling practice today, well done!"

By rewarding their **hard work and persistence**, you teach them that what matters most is trying their best, not just getting the perfect score. This builds a strong, resilient mindset that will serve them well in the future.

#### 4. Create a "Focus Zone"
Your child needs a space that's just for studying. It doesn't have to be a big study room—it can be a small corner of the dining table. The key is to make it a **distraction-free zone**.

When it's "Homework Time," make sure the TV is off, and put away any iPads or phones. If you're using a computer for homework, close all other browser tabs. This simple step teaches them to associate that space with serious work, which helps train their brain to focus.

#### 5. Be a Role Model
Remember, your child is always watching you. If you're constantly on your phone, checking messages, or scrolling through social media, they will see that as normal behavior.

Show them what focus looks like. Put your own phone away during family meals or during "Homework Time." Show enthusiasm for your own work or hobbies. When they see you focused on a task and finishing it, they will learn to do the same.

### The Bigger Picture

Grades are important, of course, but self-discipline and focus are the true building blocks of success. By intentionally helping your child develop these skills now, you’re giving them a gift that will last a lifetime. You're not just preparing them for the next exam; you’re preparing them for life.

> **Take Action**
> Start by creating a "Homework Time". Routines work for people of all ages, and especially so for children.
