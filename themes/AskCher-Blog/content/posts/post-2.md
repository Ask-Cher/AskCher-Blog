# Smart Screens, Healthy Habits: Guiding Your Child's Digital Journey in Primary School

In today's digital age, screens are an undeniable part of our children's lives. From e-learning tools to interactive games, digital devices offer incredible opportunities for learning and discovery. However, many Singaporean parents share a common concern: how to ensure their children use screens wisely and responsibly, avoiding the pitfalls of excessive use. This article explores the latest guidelines and offers practical ways to cultivate healthy digital habits for your primary school child.

### Understanding the Landscape: Screen Time Concerns and Guidelines

Concerns about excessive screen time are valid and widely discussed among parents and educators. Research indicates that too much screen use in early years can lead to insufficient physical activity, poorer language skills, shorter attention spans, and negative impacts on social interactions and emotional well-being. Recognizing these concerns, Singapore's Ministry of Health (MOH) revised its screen time recommendations for children in January 2025, emphasizing stricter guidelines as part of the "Grow Well SG" national strategy.

The goal is not to ban screens entirely, but to ensure they are used intentionally and meaningfully. Positive screen time should be active, not passive, with digital content aligning with learning goals and encouraging interaction.

### Cultivating Positive Digital Habits: A Parent's Guide

How can parents navigate this digital landscape effectively? Here are key strategies:

#### 1. Set Clear Boundaries and Consistent Rules
Establish specific limits for screen use each day and for particular activities. Communicate these rules clearly to your child, perhaps even creating a "digital contract" together. Consistency in applying these rules is paramount; children learn boundaries when consequences are predictable. Start with stricter controls at a younger age, gradually shifting towards more independence as your child matures.

#### 2. Prioritize Purposeful Screen Use
Encourage the use of educational apps and interactive content that genuinely supports learning and development. Instead of allowing "mindless games," guide your child towards applications that enhance math, language, science, or critical thinking skills. Look for apps that engage children actively, rather than just passively consuming content. For example, an app that helps them focus on tasks or complete homework can transform screen time into productive time.

#### 3. Utilize Parental Control Tools
Many apps and devices offer built-in parental control features that allow you to manage screen time, block inappropriate content, and monitor online activities. These tools empower parents to set usage boundaries, filter web content, and even track app usage, providing valuable insights into a child's digital behavior.Consider using these features to create a safer and more structured digital environment for your child.

#### 4. Engage Together and Model Healthy Habits
Watch educational videos or play games with your child. Ask open-ended questions before, during, and after screen time to guide critical thinking and discussions. This transforms screen time into a shared learning experience. Crucially, model the screen habits you wish to see in your children. Take regular breaks from your own devices, set aside screen-free times (e.g., during meals), and prioritize offline fun and family interactions.

#### 5. Prioritize Privacy and Data Security
Before allowing your child to use any app, understand its privacy policy. Ensure it clearly states what information is collected, how it's used, and whether it's shared with third parties. For children under 13, explicit parental consent is required for data collection. Choose apps that prioritize data minimization and enhanced data protection, demonstrating a commitment to safeguarding your child's sensitive information.

By embracing these strategies, parents can transform screens from a source of concern into a powerful tool for learning, discipline, and healthy development, guiding their children towards safely and responsibly navigating the digital world that is an integral part of their future.
